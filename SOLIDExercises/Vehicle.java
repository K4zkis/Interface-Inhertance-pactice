/* the idea in this Exercise is to redesign a given class structure 
to something adhering the SOLID Principles
I Will Write the given UML in here and create the redesigned class below

Vehicle
-------------------------------------------------
-engineSize: int
-manualAssistance: boolean
-waterPowered: boolean
-currentSpeedInNauticalMilesPerHour
-currentSpeedInLandMilesPerHour
-abilityToFly: boolean
-numberOfAxles: int
------------------------------------------------
// getter and setter methods 

------> why is abilityToFly here --> should be an interface
------> nautical miles makes no sense with a car and if needed should be a calculation
-------> water powered should probably also be an interface

public class Vehicle {

}
